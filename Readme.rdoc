= teapot

It's imperative to respond correctly to coffee machine BREW requests when you are, in fact, a teapot. This piece of Rack middleware will ensure you comply with HTCPCP/1.0: the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol.

Your Rack application will now serve English Breakfast and respond with a <tt>418 I'm a teapot</tt> if it receives any <tt>BREW</tt> or <tt>application/coffee-pot-command</tt> requests.

Hater of English Breakfast? You're in luckâ€”just pass in your preferred brew.
